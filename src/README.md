# TODO:
## Non-negotiable
- [✓] "Command" mode: pass it the path to anything executable that takes a fen and
      depth, and returns a split perft.
- [✓] Testing with other engines
- [✓] Gracefully handle max-depth
- [✓] Off by one error in reporting panel?
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Error modal?
- [ ] Make diff table a scrollable list
- [ ] Make sure `Colored` works on Powershell/windows

## Down-the-line
- [ ] Add `?` keybinding for help modal, or something similar

## Nice-to-haves
- [ ] Scale board depending on the terminal size?
- [ ] Change fen/depth in-app?
- [ ] Expand globs?
- [ ] Update simbelmyne-chess library
  - Does this mean I need all the same compile targets (BMI2, etc)?

## Meta
- [ ] Write up nicer README
- [ ] Write github action for releases
- [ ] CI?
